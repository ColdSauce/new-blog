## I finally have my own hosted blog!

Picking a good enough Hugo theme was so incredibly difficult, but at least for right now, I picked the hugo-zen theme. There were a few issues I found with it so I modified it a bunch. But as a foundation, I've found it to be very good.

I wanted to add my own flavor to it so I added a glitch art image and changed the coloring a bit to match it. I want to do some cool CSS stuff where that image will animate and have the glitch effect look even cooler. I also want to see if I can do other stuff to make the website look more interesting.

I hate minimalism.
